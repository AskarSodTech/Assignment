Release Notes: Version 1.0

**Features:**

1. Movie List Display: The app now displays a grid of movies categorized as "Romantic Comedy" on Page 3. The movies are presented in a grid layout, with 3 columns in portrait mode and 7 columns in landscape mode, providing an optimal user experience on various devices.
2. Infinite Scrolling: Users can scroll through the movie list seamlessly with infinite scrolling. As the user approaches the end of the list, more content is dynamically loaded to ensure a continuous browsing experience.
3. Search Functionality: A search bar is provided to allow users to search for movies by title. The search bar activates when the user enters at least three characters, and the search results update in real-time as the user types.
4. Placeholder Images: For any movie without a valid poster image, a placeholder image is displayed to ensure a consistent and aesthetic user interface.

**Known Issues and Limitations:**

1. Missing Posters: Some movies may have missing poster images, resulting in a placeholder being displayed. This is due to incomplete data in the JSON content files. Future updates will address this issue by providing complete data for all movies.
2. No Error Handling: The app currently lacks comprehensive error handling for scenarios such as JSON parsing failures or network issues. Future updates will include robust error handling to provide a better user experience and prevent crashes.
3. Limited Content: The app currently only displays movies from the "Romantic Comedy" category from local json file. Future versions may extend the app to include more categories and pages for a broader selection of movies.
4. Error Handling: Add appropriate error handling to handle any exceptions that may occur while loading data from assets or parsing JSON files in the MovieRepository. For example, you can display a friendly error message to the user if there's a problem loading data.
5. Loading Indicators: When data is being fetched or processed, such as loading the next page or searching for movies, consider adding loading indicators (e.g., ProgressBar or Shimmer effect) to provide feedback to the user and avoid confusion.
6. Empty States: Handle cases where there are no movies to display in the RecyclerView. You can show a message or a placeholder image to indicate that there are no results.
7. RecyclerView Item Clicks: Consider adding click listeners to the items in the RecyclerView to allow users to interact with the movie items (e.g., view details or perform actions).
8. Search Suggestion: In the search feature, you can consider implementing search suggestions as the user types to assist them in finding movies.
9. Data Pagination: Ensure that the pagination logic works smoothly and provides a seamless experience when loading more data as the user scrolls through the RecyclerView.
10. Memory and Resource Optimization: Continue optimizing the app's memory usage and resource handling to avoid potential performance issues and to minimize the APK size.
11. Accessibility: Make sure that the app is accessible to users with disabilities. This includes proper labeling for elements, content descriptions for images, and adhering to accessibility guidelines.
12. Consistent Styling: Double-check that the styling, colors, and fonts are consistent with the design. This helps maintain a cohesive and professional look for the app.
13. Testing on Different Devices: Test the app on various devices and screen sizes to ensure it works well and looks good on all of them.

**Future Enhancements:**
1. Additional Categories: We plan to expand the app to include multiple movie categories, allowing users to explore different genres and themes.
2. Sorting and Filtering: Users will have the ability to sort and filter the movie list based on different criteria such as release date or rating.
3. Movie Details: We are working on adding a detailed view for each movie, providing users with more information, such as synopsis, cast, and trailers.
4. Offline Support: In the upcoming releases, we will introduce offline support, allowing users to browse and search for movies even without an internet connection.
5. Enhanced Error Handling: We aim to implement comprehensive error handling to provide meaningful error messages and handle edge cases more gracefully.
