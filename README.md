Release Notes: Version 1.0

**Features:**

1. Movie List Display: The app now displays a grid of movies categorized as "Romantic Comedy" on Page 3. The movies are presented in a grid layout, with 3 columns in portrait mode and 7 columns in landscape mode, providing an optimal user experience on various devices.
2. Infinite Scrolling: Users can scroll through the movie list seamlessly with infinite scrolling. As the user approaches the end of the list, more content is dynamically loaded to ensure a continuous browsing experience.
3. Search Functionality: A search bar is provided to allow users to search for movies by title. The search bar activates when the user enters at least three characters, and the search results update in real-time as the user types.
4. Placeholder Images: For any movie without a valid poster image, a placeholder image is displayed to ensure a consistent and aesthetic user interface.

**Known Issues and Limitations:**
1. Missing Posters: Some movies may have missing poster images, resulting in a placeholder being displayed. This is due to incomplete data in the JSON content files. Future updates will address this issue by providing complete data for all movies.
2. No Error Handling: The app currently lacks comprehensive error handling for scenarios such as JSON parsing failures or network issues. Future updates will include robust error handling to provide a better user experience and prevent crashes.
3. Limited Content: The app currently only displays movies from the "Romantic Comedy" category on Page 3. Future versions may extend the app to include more categories and pages for a broader selection of movies.

**Future Enhancements:**

1. Additional Categories: We plan to expand the app to include multiple movie categories, allowing users to explore different genres and themes.
2. Sorting and Filtering: Users will have the ability to sort and filter the movie list based on different criteria such as release date or rating.
3. Movie Details: We are working on adding a detailed view for each movie, providing users with more information, such as synopsis, cast, and trailers.
4. Offline Support: In the upcoming releases, we will introduce offline support, allowing users to browse and search for movies even without an internet connection.
5. Enhanced Error Handling: We aim to implement comprehensive error handling to provide meaningful error messages and handle edge cases more gracefully.
6. We hope you enjoy using the app and discovering your favorite romantic comedies. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.
